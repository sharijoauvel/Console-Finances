You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.
Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset.
The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
You will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/(Number of months - 1))
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
